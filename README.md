# Lifeboat Theory - Seed Document
Main repository for Lifeboat Theory

“Here’s how this works: our ship goes down. We’re all in a life boat, and we’ve got 11 people on it. Who’s the first one you throw overboard? Who’s the second? Who’s the third?” Robert F. Smith - Vista Equity Partners

As traditional 9-5 knowledge worker employment becomes evermore perilous to navigate, and also evermore divorced from the qualities that define the digital age, an alternative system is offered here. If we imagine traditional corporations as large ships, then imagine that as that ship becomes more hostile and difficult to live and work on, the inhabitants (employees) will abandon ship and set off in an available lifeboat. What would this lifeboat look like, however? How will it navigate and sustain the lives that have sought refuge on it? These are questions with an infinite number of potential answers. Lifeboat Theory, as described here, is one framework for providing those answers.

## Lifeboat Origins
Regardless of how one feels about corporations politically (or otherwise), the fact of the matter is that major flaws of corporations in the digital age are that they are hulking, slow-moving and have kludgy interfaces. Joining a corporation as an employee is a major life decision that requires a significant amount of time and effort. Once you are hired, however, your employment is under constant threat from decisions far from your purview many layers above within and even outside the corporation, and completely outside of your control. You will almost certainly be joining a 'department' of sorts, which can be reorganized or completely terminated at any time. Additionally, much of how a corporation is structured today is remnant of archaic practices from Industrial Age factories.

## Mapping out the Traditional Corporation Replacement
How can this situation with traditional corporations be remedied? In simple terms: change the medium of work and eliminate the hulking, slow-moving, kludgy object known as a corporation. In order to do this, the size of the object we are dealing with needs to be drastically downsized. So why not downsize to the smallest viable size possible? Jeff Bezos popularized the idea of having 'two-pizza teams', which is the concept that a team within a corporation (specifically Amazon), should be no larger than a team that can consume 2 pizzas maximum. Why not have a two-pizza organization itself? Now just replace 'two-pizza' with small lifeboat. We now have the sketch of the first invariant for our organization: very small size.

What about time demands? Traditional full-time employment demands a full 40 hours a week minimum. That's an extremely large amount of time for someone to devote to a single organization, which roughly translates to 2000 hours a year. Let's borrow here from Tim Ferris and chop that down to 4 hours a week. We now have our second invariant: workers on the lifeboat work a maximum of 4 hours a week.

What about governance? Surely, a lifeboat without some kind of governance is just chaotic and doomed to catastrophe. Let's assign a Benevolent Dictator. Their job is to govern the lifeboat, and make the final decisions. However, they are not just manager types coming down with edicts from the clouds. They have to row the lifeboat just like everybody else. How much they get rewarded for taking on additional responsibilites is a negotiation with the rest of the lifeboat crew. Additionally, each crewmember on their lifeboat is only devoting 4 hours a week to the lifeboat, making it much easier for them to terminate their relationship with the lifeboat and the Benevolent Dictator, depending on the circumstances. In general, individuals can be on multiple lifeboats throughout a given week. If their relationship is terminated with one lifeboat, they still have others they are on.

How do people actually work while on the lifeboat? No more silos or people being assigned tasks to be done individually. All decisions are made in the open with all crewmates and all tasks are recorded. To achieve this, we borrow from the technique of Mob Programming:
