# Lifeboat Theory - Seed Document
Main repository for Lifeboat Theory

“Here’s how this works: our ship goes down. We’re all in a life boat, and we’ve got 11 people on it. Who’s the first one you throw overboard? Who’s the second? Who’s the third?” Robert F. Smith - Vista Equity Partners

As traditional employment becomes evermore perilous to navigate, and also is evermore divorced from the qualities that define the digital age, an alternative system is offered here. If we imagine traditional corporations as a large ship, then imagine that as that ship becomes more hostile and difficult to live and work on, the inhabitants (employees) will abandon ship and set off in an available lifeboat. What would this lifeboat look like, however? How will it navigate and sustain the lives that have sought refuge on it? These are straigtforward questions with an infinite number of potential answers. The Lifeboat Theory, as described here, is one framework for providing those answers.
